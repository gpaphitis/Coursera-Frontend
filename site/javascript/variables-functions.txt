Variables are only defined as 'var x= '
Their type is  decided at run time

Functions
functiona {

}
OR
var a = function () {   }
So a has the function as a value NOT the return value of the option

In both ways the invocation of a function is done as a();

Parameters and return values
function compare (x,y)      //No type specified for the variables
    return x>y;             //No return type defined anywhere
