Follows 4 rules

1. Origin:
Last declaration wins

2. Merge:
If many styles refer to the same element but their rules are for different style options then they are simply merged
Example
one.css
h1 {
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
}
two.css
h1 {
    font-size: 20px:
    color: black;
}

Then the font size will be 20 px ,weight bold and color will be the stylesheet declared last

3. Inheritance
A property specified on an element will carry over to all child elements of that element
Example
body {
    font-size: 20px;
    color: red;
}
p {
    color: blue;
}

The font size for all elements in the body will be 20px and color red but p elements in the body tage will be color blue instead of red

4. Specificity
Most specific selector combination wins

Use score system
For each style write the according number to the boxes and the higher the number the more specific it is
style="..."(inline definition)      ID      Class or pseudoclass        # of elements

Examples            style       ID      Class       # of Elements
<h1 style="...">    1           0       0           0                   Highest possible specificity
div p {...}         0           0       0           2                   Only defines two elements
div #myParag{...}   0           1       0           1
div.big p{...}      0           0       1           2

To make sure a style of a rule will ovewrite every declaration use !important
Example
h1 {
    color: red; !important
}
