        With heart aglow and spirit strong,
        He journeyed far and righted wrong,
        A beacon in the darkest night,
        His presence brought a guiding light.
    <div class="divclass">
        Through trials vast and battles fierce,
        He stood unwavering, without a pierce,
        His shield of truth, his sword of might,
        He vanquished darkness with sheer delight.

        And mended souls that others strip,
        <span id="spanId">With kindness, he would always give,</span>
        And teach us all how to forgive.

        In humble ways, he lent a hand,
        To lift the fallen, help them stand,
        No challenge faced was ever too great,
        He faced them all with steadfast gait.

        With friends and allies, he was widespread,
        For TopG Paphitis knew the might,
        Of friendship's bond, shining so bright.
    </div>
    <div>
        Through countless battles he'd persist,
        With courage rising like the mist,
        In every heart, he left his mark,
        A hero true, an eternal spark.
    </div>
    <div>
        In tales that echo through the years,
        His name will wash away our fears,
        For TopG Paphitis, valiant and grand,
